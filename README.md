Machine Learning Project: Predicting Chronic Kidney
Disease (CKD)
Problem Statement: The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) based on various medical features such as blood
pressure, blood sugar levels, and other health indicators. This is a binary
classification task where the target variable (class) indicates the presence (ckd) or
absence (notckd) of the disease.
Objectives:
• Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
• Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
• Preprocess the data to handle missing values and categorical features.
• Build a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has CKD.
• Evaluate the performance of the model.
Key Features:
• Numerical Features: Age, Blood Pressure (bp), Blood Glucose Random (bgr),
Blood Urea (bu), Serum Creatinine (sc), Sodium (sod), Potassium (pot),
Hemoglobin (hemo), Packed Cell Volume (pcv), White Blood Cell Count (wc),
Red Blood Cell Count (rc).
• Categorical Features: Specific Gravity (sg), Albumin (al), Sugar (su), Red
Blood Cells (rbc), Pus Cell (pc), Pus Cell Clumps (pcc), Bacteria (ba),
Hypertension (htn), Diabetes Mellitus (dm), Coronary Artery Disease (cad),
Appetite, Pedal Edema, Anemia.
• Target Variable: class (whether the patient has CKD: ckd or notckd).
